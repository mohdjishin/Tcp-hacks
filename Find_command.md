## Find command ðŸ”Ž


***When you know exactly what youâ€™re looking for, you donâ€™t need to search for it; you just have to find it .***



Two very useful flags are the **==-type==** and **-==name==** flags. With -type, you can use** d to only find directories**, and** f to only find files**. 

- eg

	- Find all files whose name ends with ".xml"	
	``find / -type f  -name *.xml``
	
-	Find all files in the /home directory (recursive) whose name is "user.txt" (case insensitive)
	``find /home -type f -iname user.txt``
	(-iname is same as name but it is case insensitive)
	
-	Find all directories whose name contains the word "exploits"
	``find / -type d -name *exploits*``
	``find / -type d -iname *exploits*``
	
	
	***In some situations, specifying just the name of a file will not be enough. You can also specify the owner, the size, the permissions***
	
The username of the owner of a file is specified with the **-user** flag.



- eg
	-Find all files owned by the user "kittycat"
	``find / -type f -user kittycat``
#### Size

-The size of a file is specified with the **-size** flag

- When using numerical values, the formats ==-n, +n, and n== can be used, where n is a number.==-n== matches values lesser than n, ==+n== matches values greater than n, and n matches values exactly n. To specify a size, you also need a suffix. ==c== is the suffix for bytes, ==k for KiBâ€™s==, and ==M for MiBâ€™s==. So, if you want to specify a size less than 30 bytes, the argument ==-30c== should be used.
- eg
 	Find all files that are exactly 150 bytes in size
	``find / -type f -size 150c``
	Find all files in the /home directory (recursive) with size less than 2 KiBâ€™s and extension ".txt"
	``find /home -type f -size -2K -name *.txt``


#### Permissions

-The==-perm== flag is used to specify permissions, either in octal form (ex.==644==) or in symbolic form (ex. u=r). See here for a short reference. If you specify the permission mode as shown above (ex.==644 or u=r==), then ==find== will only return files with those permissions exactly. You can use the ==â€“ or /== prefix to make your search more inclusive. Using the ==â€“== prefix will return files with at least the permissions you specify; this means that the ==-444== mode will match files that are readable by everyone, even if someone also has write and/or execute permissions. Using the==/== prefix will return files that match any of the permissions you have set; this means that the ==/666== mode will match files that are readable and writeable by at least one of the groups (owner, group, or others).

- eg
-	Find all files that are exactly readable and writeable by the owner, and readable by everyone else (use octal format)
		``find / -type f -perm 644``
	
-	Find all files that are only readable by anyone (use octal format)
		``find / -type f -perm /444``
	
-	Find all files with write permission for the group "others", regardless of any other permissions, with extension ".sh" (use symbolic format)
		``find / -type f -perm -o=w -name "*.sh"``
-	Find all files in the /usr/bin directory (recursive) that are owned by root and have at least the SUID permission (use symbolic format)
	``find /usr/bin -type f -user root -perm -u=s``


#### Time
 These are more complex but may prove useful. The flag consists of a word and a prefix. The words are ==min and time==, for minutes and days, respectively. The prefixes are ==a, m, and c==, and are used to specify when a file was last accessed, modified, or had its status changed. As for the numerical values, the same rules of the -size flag apply, except there is no suffix. To put it all together: in order to specify that a file was last accessed more than 30 minutes ago, the option ==-amin +30== is used. To specify that it was modified less than 7 days ago, the option ==-mtime -7== is used. (Note: when you want to specify that a file was modified within the last 24 hours, the option -==mtime 0== is used.)
 
 - eg
- 	Find all files that were not accessed in the last 10 days with extension ".png"
	``find / -type f -atime  +10 -name *.png``
-	Find all files in the /usr/bin directory (recursive) that have been modified within the last 2 hours
	``find /usr/bin -type f -mmin +120``
	

### Tips
The first is that you can use the redirection operator > with the find command. You can save the results of the search to a file, and more importantly, you can suppress the output of any possible errors to make the output more readable. This is done by appending ==2> /dev/null== to your command. This way, you wonâ€™t see any results youâ€™re not allowed to access.
- eg
-	``find /usr/bin -type f -mmin +120  2> /dev/null``


 - The second thing is the ==-exec== flag. You can use it in your find command to execute a new command, following the -exec flag, like so:==-exec whoami \;==. The possibilities enabled by this option are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but most notably it can be used for privilege escalation.
